# CSE-Labs
This project aimed to develop a set of labs to deliver the core concepts of Control Systems and Engineering in a significantly simpler, more informative and interactive way. All the labs are designed based on plug and play, enabling the user to enter a set of inputs and record the automatically generated outputs. Each lab instance is created using the MATLAB App Designer. Each lab has two components: the first is manual, and the second is the link to lab simulation. The manual contains experiment theory and all the steps required to perform the experiments on the corresponding lab's simulations. To know more about the working of the labs, please refer to the manual attached to each specific lab.
